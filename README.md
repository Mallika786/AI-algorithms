***AI Algorithms: Hill Climbing, A* Algorithm, and Uniform Cost Search***
*Overview*
This repository contains implementations of three fundamental artificial intelligence algorithms: Hill Climbing, A* Algorithm, and Uniform Cost Search. These algorithms are widely used in various domains including robotics, gaming, planning, and optimization problems.

Algorithms Implemented:
1. Hill Climbing
Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm used for mathematical optimization problems. It starts with an arbitrary solution and iteratively makes small adjustments to the current solution, always choosing the neighboring solution with the highest improvement, until no such improvements are possible. This algorithm is simple and efficient but may get stuck in local optima.

2. A* Algorithm
A* (pronounced "A star") is a widely used graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks or game maps. A* uses a heuristic to guide its search, making it both informed and efficient. It guarantees the optimal solution when certain conditions are met.

3. Uniform Cost Search
Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is another graph traversal algorithm that finds the lowest-cost path from a given initial node to a goal node in a weighted graph. Unlike A*, UCS does not use a heuristic function and instead explores the graph uniformly, always choosing the lowest-cost path available. It is optimal for finding the lowest-cost path but may be less efficient than A* in certain scenarios.
